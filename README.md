# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies based on user preferences using machine learning techniques. The system utilizes **collaborative filtering**, **content-based filtering**, and **hybrid approaches** to generate accurate movie recommendations. The goal is to provide users with personalized movie suggestions based on their past ratings and movie descriptions.

## Dataset

- **movies.csv**: Contains movie titles, genres, and descriptions.

## Key Features and Contributions
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Identifies similar users or items (movies) based on past ratings to recommend movies.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on features like genre and description using techniques such as **TF-IDF Vectorization**.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines **Collaborative Filtering** and **Content-Based Filtering** to improve recommendation accuracy.

## Tools & Libraries
The following libraries were used in this project:

- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, TensorFlow, Flask (for deployment)
- **Preprocessing**: Tokenization, vectorization, and data cleaning techniques were applied to prepare the data for model building.
- **Modeling & Evaluation**: Collaborative filtering models, content-based recommendation using **TF-IDF** and **Cosine Similarity**, and hybrid models were used to generate recommendations.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Load the dataset and clean the data.
   - Tokenize and vectorize movie descriptions for **content-based filtering**.
   - Handle missing values and format data for model input.

2. **Collaborative Filtering**: 
   - Build a collaborative filtering model based on **User-User** and **Item-Item** similarity.
   - Implement **Matrix Factorization** techniques like **SVD** for better recommendations.

3. **Content-Based Filtering**: 
   - Use **TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert movie descriptions into numerical vectors.
   - Apply **Cosine Similarity** to measure the similarity between movies.

4. **Hybrid Model**: 
   - Combine both **Collaborative Filtering** and **Content-Based Filtering** approaches for better accuracy.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's accuracy by generating recommendations and comparing them to known preferences.

## Results
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Generated personalized recommendations based on user-item interactions.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommended movies based on textual descriptions and features.
- **Hybrid Model**: Combined the strengths of both approaches, yielding more accurate and relevant movie recommendations.
  
## Practical Applications
- **Personalized Movie Suggestions**: The system provides users with recommendations based on their past ratings and movie features.
- **Recommendation System Optimization**: Can be applied to other domains such as e-commerce, online platforms, and social media for personalized content recommendations.
- **Web Application**: Optionally, the system can be deployed as a web app for interactive movie recommendation browsing.

## Conclusion
This Movie Recommendation System employs advanced data science techniques like **Collaborative Filtering**, **Content-Based Filtering**, and **Hybrid Approaches** to provide users with personalized movie suggestions. The use of **machine learning** models ensures that recommendations are accurate and tailored to individual preferences.
